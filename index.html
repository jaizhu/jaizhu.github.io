      Yay! Welcome to my website!

     If you told me a couple years ago that I would eventually fall in love with programming, I would have probably given you a skeptical yet humorous look and not given that another thought. However, now as a sophomore in college, what would have been a joke is now very much a reality. The nervousness I had as a freshman evolved into eagerness to explore everything that the school I attend, the University of Michigan had, to offer.  But while exploring MHacks, our school's hackathon, that eagerness became curiosity, and somehow that curiosity became passion. I am continuously amazed and driven by the power that technology has given us as a society. To me, being able to code is like having a super power to turn any idea into something real. My goal is to elegantly combine the power and innovation of this incredible tool to do everything I can to make our society better.
